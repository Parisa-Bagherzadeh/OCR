# License plate recognition
### EASYOCR 
 I've used easyocr library on English and Persian license plates and handwritings
You can see the result in easyocr.ipynb file.  
### DTRB
As you see, the results of easyocr are not desirable, so I used this repository  
```https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark``` istead to get better results on recognizing license plates
