# License plate recognition
### EASYOCR vs DTRB  
 I've used easyocr library is used on English and Persian license plate and handwriting  
You can see the result in easyocr.ipynb file.  
As you can see, the results are not desirable, so I used this repository  
 ``` https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark ``` istead to get better results on recognizing license plates
